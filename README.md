# template-acceptance-tests

This repo contain the acceptance tests for the [template] service.

It is built using:

cucumber 1.2.4

java 1.8

Scala 2.11.7

SBT to build 0.13.17

**Getting started:**
   
    Ensure that you have a working linux environment.

**Execution:**
   
    In /src/test/scala/uk/gov/hmrc/integration/cucumber there are scala classes which control what is run according to the tests tagged with the below tags. 
    The main class is Runner which selects and runs tests marked @. You can run ./run_integration_local.sh to run tests against a local version of the application

###  Test Automation environment setup

    1. Ensure that you have installed InteliJ Idea
    2. Once you have installed IDEA install Cucumber for scala
    3. Clone this repo.
    4. Import the project into InteliJ
    
###  Project structure
Each part of the application's functionality is described by feature files. The feature files are arranged into folders under src/test/features and grouped into the main areas of the application.
Each step of the feature files is defined by executable test steps in the scala code under the src/test/scala/uk/gov/hmrc/integration/test/stepdefs area and those utilise Page object models under src/test/scala/uk/gov/hmrc/integration/cucumber/pages which are the single place where page specific properties and variables are configured.

### Browser Testing
In order to run the tests via BrowserStack you need to create the following files with your BrowserStack username and automate key: 
 
  ~/Applications/hmrc-development-environment/hmrc/itr-acceptance-tests/src/test/resources/browserConfig.properties
 

To get your username and automate key go [here](https://www.browserstack.com/accounts/settings)
Alternatively if you access[www.browserstack.com/automate](http://www.browserstack.com/automate)and select **Username and Access Keys** on the left tab your credentials will be displayed 

**Note** browserstack.com/accounts/settings displays the automate key as the access key.


Then you need to change the project name and description within the SingletonDriver.scala file.
You can use the search everywhere function within IntelliJ (Ctrl + Shift + F) to find these entries.
 - desCaps.setCapability("project", "projectName")
 - desCaps.setCapability("build", "your project name Build_1.X")
 
For our first run this was set to:
 - desCaps.setCapability("project", "projectName")
 - desCaps.setCapability("build", "Local Complete TestBuild_0.1")

To add a browser to be tested via BrowserStack, a json object needs to be created within the itr-acceptance-tests/src/test/resources/browserstackdata folder with the following information:
Note ideally these should be representing the latest versions of the chosen browser and/or devices.
 
    Desktop browser:
        - browser
        - browser_version
        - os
        - os_version
           
    Mobile Browser:
        - browserName
        - platform
        - device

The title of the JSON file should be as follows: 
BS_OS/Device_Version_Browser_BrowserVersion

For Example:

    BS_Win10_Chrome_v64

Once the JSON objects have been created, these need to be added to the run_browserstack.sh script.

To execute select **run_browserstack.sh** script

Note i - if you only wish to run either the browsers or devices you need to remove the relevant entry from within run_browserstack.sh

Note ii - the changes made to browserConfig.properties should not be pushed to GitHub and therefore you should make sure that this file is included on the gitignore file for your project
 
 ### Penetration Testing via ZAP
 
 Initially please see Confluence instructions which can be found [here](https://confluence.tools.tax.service.gov.uk/display/DTRG/Security+Testing) to access the ZAP application if it resides on your machine
 The Links section on the above page will have instructions for configuring ZAP to run from the GUI application
 
 The tests are executed by running **run_zap.sh** (which calls ZapScanTest.scala)
 
 - **Outputs**
  When executed successfully a file is generated under the 'target' class of the project under zap-reports and listed as **report.html**
  Select this file to access 'chrome' or 'firefox' icon which will open the report in your Chrome or Firefox browser

 ### Messages
    
 If there is a requirement to verify any text within your application users should create a messages.properties file and place it in the following location where it can be referenced:
  
  ~/Applications/pe/template-acceptance-tests/src/test/resources/
